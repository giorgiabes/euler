    Mathematical approach:
    1. Multiples of n are: n, 2n, 3n, 4n, ..., pn (where pn < TARGET)
    2. Factor out n: n Ã— (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + p)

    - Sum(3 or 5) = Sum(3) + Sum(5) - Sum(both 3 and 5)
    - "Both 3 and 5" means multiples of LCM(3,5) = 15

    Why subtract Sum(15)?
    Numbers like 15, 30, 45... are divisible by both 3 and 5,

    We subtract them once to avoid double-counting.
